# CIS3120
This was created as apart of an assignment for the class 3120 Data Analytics for CUNY Baruch College.


The goal of this project was to assess the performance of 5 distinct stocks during the 2022 fiscal year and compare their performances to the S&P500.

The notebook attached evaluated Nvidia, Tesla, Jpmorgan, Coca-Cola & 3M.
